# Parallel Orchestration Status

## Summary

- Skill: `zt-parallel-dev-orchestrator`
- Branch: `main`
- Last sync with origin: up-to-date before orchestration start
- Active strategy: Batch-based module ownership execution

## Batch 2 Completion (B + C + D)

| Module | Owner | Status | Owned Paths | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B (Run Persistence) | worker-agent | Completed | `src/game/run/**`, `src/game/save/**`, `src/types/save/**`, `tests/run-save/**` | 19 passed |
| C (Core Combat Simulation) | worker-agent | Completed | `src/game/combat/**`, `src/game/waves/**`, `src/game/sim/**`, `tests/combat/**` | 11 passed |
| D (Economy/Reward Engine) | worker-agent | Completed | `src/game/economy/**`, `src/game/rewards/**`, `src/game/relics/**`, `tests/economy/**` | 12 passed |

## Integration Checks

- Combined tests:
  - `node --test tests/run-save/**/*.test.js tests/combat/**/*.test.js tests/economy/**/*.test.js tests/integration/**/*.test.js`
  - Result: 45 passed, 0 failed
- Schema/sample validation:
  - `python tools/validate-schemas.py`
  - Result: 10/10 pairs passed

## Gate Status (A-E)

1. Gate A (Contracts frozen): `GREEN`
2. Gate B (Foundation modules merged): `GREEN`
3. Gate C (Combat/Run core merged): `GREEN`
4. Gate D (UI/HUD integrated): `GREEN`
5. Gate E (Validation + save/replay checks passing): `GREEN`
   - Local full checks pass (`schema + tests + deterministic smoke`).
   - CI workflow for push/pull_request has been added.

## Batch 3 Completion (E)

| Module | Owner | Status | Owned Paths | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E (UI State + Integration) | worker-agent | Completed | `src/ui/**`, `src/render/**`, `src/main/**`, `tests/integration/**` | 3 passed |

## Batch 4 Completion (F)

| Module | Owner | Status | Owned Paths | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F (Tooling + CI Checks) | worker-agent | Completed | `tools/**`, `.github/workflows/**` | readiness check pass |

## Remaining Blockers

1. Ready for feature development batch (M0 gameplay vertical slice).
2. 추가 e2e 범위 확장(멀티웨이브/중단후재개 장시간)만 남아있음.

## Next Parallel Batch Plan

1. Batch 5: M0 gameplay vertical slices (병렬)
   - VS1: summon/board interaction
   - VS2: wave progression and reward loop
   - VS3: result/history screen integration
2. Batch 6: polish and performance gates
